# On-device Bug Reporting Application

Project Description:
As mobile applications have become increasingly popular computing tools, they have evolved in terms of complexity and relative number of features. In today’s highly competitive mobile application marketplaces, such as Google Play and Apple’s App Store, only high­quality, fault­free applications can be successful. As such, it is imperative that developers fix bugs encountered by testers and users quickly. However, the current state of practice for users creating reviews is through app store reviews, which in turn requires a large effort on the part of the developer in order to sift through the myriad of user responses and determine which ones represent actual bugs. Mobile application testers typically rely on loosely structured natural language bug reports to convey issues to developers, but these reports are typically lacking in important information.

The SEMERU research team has taken the first step towards rectifying this problem in the form of the FUSION bug reporting mechanism. However, this mechanism currently only exists on the web. The goal of this project will be to enable on­device reporting of applications bugs using a record replay framework. The team working on this project will be responsible for implementing an Android application that is capable of recording highly accurate, low­level user input, and high­level sensor (e.g. accelerometer, gyroscope) traces. The app should then align, format and send this data to a remote server where the traces will be replayed to construct a FUSION bug bug report.
There are several different technologies that the team will need to become familiar with in order to successfully complete this project, including but not limited to, the Android Platform and SDK, and client­server web technologies and databases.
